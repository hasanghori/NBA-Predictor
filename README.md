NBA Predictor

The goal of this program is to see how accurately one could predict NBA games within the NBA bubble 2019/2020 seasons.
To measure the accuracy of my program, I compared to sports betters. It is said that you break even if you can bet with an accuracy of 52.4% and the best professional betters are about 55% accurate.

Since the NBA bubble is consisted of an 8 game regular season followed by teh playoffs, this program attempts to determine the best possible way to predict outcomes off of just 8 games.
It does so through 2 methods:

Method 1

This method is simple. It is used answers the question of, "What happens if I just choose a team that averages the most *insert some stat here* to win the game everytime.
Over the course of the last two seasons, if a person followed this method, they would get approximately 50-57% of their games right (depending on the stat they select).

Method 2

This method uses two stats for its prediction. It cycles through NBA games and determines the best two stat indicators for predicting games then sorts these combination of stats in a list with the most accurate at the top.
When a user enters in their matchup, the program analyzes both teams and their averages over the last games. It then compares the two teams with the list of sorted combos of stats. If a team has averages better in two stats that are on the list, the program will return the appropriate probability of this occurence.
Using this method, over the last 2 seasons, this program gets 60% of its games correct and has been predicting the current NBA playoffs at a rate of 64%
